# Contributing

This document describes the requirements and guidelines for contributing to this repository.

## New Features

Do not put files from `docs/projects/*`  in your pull requests.
It is much harder to review these, and they pose a threat to the publication process.

## Reporting Bugs

Please file issues and bugs (even typos!) on the [issues](https://github.com/ByteWelder/DroneCrafting/issues) page.
