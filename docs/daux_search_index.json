You can start here! I'm sure you are as eager as I was to start flying, but before you spend a lot of money, please consider trying out a simulator first! The drone you'll choose to fly will depend mainly on what you expect from it. Do you want to just fly at a more relaxed pace to take pictures or just cruise around? Do you want to want to do flips and rolls and all sorts of other tricks? Or do you just want to go FAST and race around, maybe against other people? That, and your budget will very likely drive you to a specific type of drone. Flying a drone is not cheap! It varies greatly depending on how and what you would like to fly. Take a look at the budget article for more information. When you have decided your budget, you can start looking for gear! Those who are planning to build their own drone should be ready to learn a lot of new and exciting things. And that's also why drones are such an exciting hobby: You get to touch lots of interesting topics, like electrical engineering, electronics, flying, motors, radio signals, video editing and probably a lot more!

Apply all necessary safety precautions when storing batteries and follow the battery manufacturer's advice at all times. This guide is intended to provide you information and advice, but it is not fool-proof or garanteed to be complete. LiPo or Li-Ion? Home-built drones are most often running LiPo (Lithium-Polymer) batteries. Even though Li-Ion batteries are lighter weight, drones benefit from the extra electric current draw that a LiPo battery can provide. This page will focus on LiPo batteries, but much of its content is just as valid for other types of batteries. First some theory There are 4 units that are relevant to batteries: Voltage: expressed in volts with its unit V and the symbol (for equations) U. Current: expressed in amps with its unit A and the symbol I. Resistance: expressed in Ohms with its unit \u03a9 and the symbol R. Power: expressed in watts with its unit W and the symbol P. Voltage is the potential difference or electric tension between two points. The voltage of the cell is one of the main drivers of how fast your drone will be able to fly. Current is the rate of flow of electric charge. So even if you have a high voltage, you still need to deliver a high enough current (more amps) to let the energy flow to your motors. Resistance is the measure that determines the amount of opposition to the flow of electrical current. Your electrical circuits will have some sort of resistance, but also the wires that connect your battery will have a (minimal) resistance. Power refers to the electrical energy that is being provided per unit of time. When we combine voltage and amps, we get power. (P = U x I) Voltage and cell count LiPo batteries are made out of multiple cells. Each cell provides roughly 3.7 V. Depending on how the cells are combined, the battery can have either more longevity and provide more current, or the battery can provide a higher voltage. A battery pack with 1 cell, delivering about 3.7 V is labelled as being a 1S battery. A battery pack with 2 cells delivers twice the voltage, so about 7.4 V and is labelled as a 2S battery. A battery pack with 3 cells delivers three times the voltage, so about 11.2 V and is labelled as a 3S battery. And so on. When a battery is charged, its voltage is higher than when it is discharged. A charged cell is generally at 4.2 V, while a discharged cell is around 3.3 V to 3.5 V, depending on context. When discharging (or using) a battery, it is very important that the voltage never drops below 3.0 V. If this happens, it could damage your battery. Voltage and &quot;sagging&quot; When a battery is under load, the voltage might drop temporarily. This effect is named &quot;sagging&quot;. The effect is especially visible on smaller drones (tinywhoops etc.) and is considered normal on them. Battery capacity The mAh rating of a battery defines its capacity. Let's take a deeper look at it: Ah is referred to as &quot;amp hours&quot;. In other words: the duration (in hours) at which a certain amount of current(amps) can be sustained. The rate at which a battery can provide power is expressed in amps (A), or milli-amps (mA). When we talk about battery capacity, we generally talk about how long it can deliver a certain amount of these amps. So when we take in effect the time in hours (h) we get A x h = Ah (or mAh). The capacity of a battery in mAh is its relative capacity: as in, it is relative to the voltage of the battery. The total energy of a battery is defined is expressed in watt-hours or Wh. This takes in account the voltage, the amps and the time (in hours). Thus, a 14.8 V battery with 1500 mAh capacity has 14.8 V x 1.5 Ah = 22,2 Wh of energy. Battery storage The energy in Wh that a battery contains is relevant when storing your batteries. Proper battery storage solution come with a Wh rating, specifying how much energy it can withhold in case of a LiPo fire. LiPo bags (the ones with velcro) will not stop a LiPo fire. It can, however, contain the flames of the LiPo fire somewhat, when you have one that is of decent quality. If you want to store your batteries safely, a solution like the BatSafe is a much safer one. This particular model is claimed to have a 220 Wh capacity. There are various videos on Youtube that showcase some LiPo fire tests. It is of utmost importance to not store your LiPos on or near a flammable surface (e.g. wood). Even if you use a more effective storage solution like a BatSafe, but especially if you only use LiPo bags. It is also not advisable to store LiPo batteries inside your house. Not only are the flames dangerous, but the fumes of the LiPo fire are toxic. &quot;C&quot; Rating The C rating of a battery refers to the rate of discharge that a battery can provide. The C rating has a direct relationship with the capacity (mAh) of a battery. Let's take a look at some examples: A 1500mAh battery specced at 1 C can deliver 1500mA * 1 = 1.5 A of current. A 2000mAh battery specced at 100 C can deliver 2000mA * 100 = 200 A of current. Thermal Runaway Thermal runaway is a self-sustaining chemical reaction inside the battery, that is potentially dangerous and can lead to fires. LiPo batteries are built to mitigate some of its effects, but it's important to safely dispose of a LiPo battery when this occurs. Thermal runaway becomes visible when the battery swells up. However, thermal runaway can also be active and only visible show symptons many hours after the reaction started internally in the battery. For more details on thermal runaway, please read this article.","tags":"","url":"Technical\/Batteries.html"},{"title":"Flight Controller","text":"Basics The flight controllers is arguably the most important part of a drone or multicopter. These tiny computer control the flight of your drone and can talk to various peripherals that are connected to it. It uses its sensors to detect parameters, such as the movement of your quad. There are 2 main parts of flight controllers: the hardware and the software (firmware). These pages will gloss over the basics of both. Hardware The topic of hardware can generally be divided in 3 main parts: CPU (processor) Physical size Features CPU This is the heart of the flight controller. The faster it is, the faster it can calculate your flight parameters. The more storage it has, the more features the software can contain. Currently, F4 and F7 flight controllers are the most common ones to find. Type Speed Storage F1 72 MHz 128 kB F3 72 MHz 256 kB F4 168 MHz 1 MB F7 216 MHz 1 MB H7 480 MHz 128 kB Read more about CPUs here. Physical Size A flight controller must fit the frame of your drone, otherwise you won't be able to mount it. Flight controller sizes are pretty much standardised. They generally are one if these: 16 x 16 mm 20 x 20 mm 30 x 30 mm 45 x 45 mm Firmware There are various firmware\/software options for your drone. The most common ones on privately built quads are BetaFlight and KISS. BetaFlight BetaFlight is open source and allows for advanced tweaking of flight parameters. Because of that, it is arguably more complex than for example KISS. KISS KISS stands for &quot;Keep It Super Simple&quot;. KISS gives you less configuration options than BetaFlight (and thus less control), and intends to make it easier for you to set up your drone. KISS firmwares are not open source, and its flight Controllers tend to be more expensive.

The author(s) take no liability for the statements below. Please act responsibly and and lawfully. An outline from the rules and regulation can be found here. Drone Classification Drones will be mainly classified based on their weight. Within each weight classification, there might also be limitations (and permissions) depending on capabilities of the drone. These sub-classifications generally cover maximum speed, or features such as GPS or failsafe. The base classification is C0, C1, C3 or C4. This will be specified by the manufacturer of store-bought drones. Privately built drones will have no classification, but they are assigned a subcategory, just like the drones that come with a classfication. Some notes on the tables below: The speed limit is the limitation of the drone, not the speed at which you fly it. &quot;Weight&quot; refers to the maximum total take-off weight, including batteries and payload.

This minimal load blew the fuse on the ESC, making the ESC unusable. The result was that BetaFlight showed 0.01 V when a lipo was connected. A friendly RushFPV customer support representative stated that this stack wasn't meant for 5&quot; quadcopters and motors with such high KV values. In my opinion, 30 A is 30 A, regardless of motor size, so I'm still under the impression that this stack just can't deliver what it says on the specifications. Thanks to the help of the RushFPV CSR, I was advised to bridge the fuse. I was given some pictures as a guide, but decided to make a comprehensive photo write-up myself. These are the tools that I used: ultra-fine tweezers soldering iron with (thin) chisel tip copper wire (preferably single core) clippers If you plan to fix your own ESC, you should understand that removing the fuse (and shorting\/bridging it) means that there is nothing preventing damage to the ESC if too much current is pulled through it. It can lead to smoke and fire if you abuse the ESC beyond its limits without this safety net. First, let's take a look at the fuse itself. It's the green SMD component on the ESC: As mentioned in the list of tools, I used a fine chisel tip: Use the clippers to splice the wire length-wise. Then cut a smaller piece off that is a bit smaller than the size of the fuse: Have your soldering iron on high heat (I put mine on 425 C) and add a little bit of solder. This solder will help spread the heat on the SMD component: Start holding the fuse with the tweezers. Don't put a lot of force on it, but make sure you grab hold of it: Bring the soldering iron to the fuse (don't push hard) and gently pull the fuse off with the tweezers: The ESC will now look like this: Add some fresh solder to the fuse pads. I used the sharp end of the chisel tip to set down my iron in a stable manner, and then I fed a little bit of solder into it: Now place the tiny piece of copper wire, with the flat side down, between the ESC fuse pads. Before you put the soldering iron down, make sure that you have some grip on the wire, as it will start sliding a bit when the solder is flowing. To solder it, just put your iron down on the copper bit and let the heat of the copper conduct into the solder and melt the solder into the copper: That's it, you've now bridged the fuse! You can test as follows: Continuity test on fuse and ESC battery pads. Power on the ESC with a battery and a smoke stopper. Remove battery power, add the FC and do another power on test with the smoke stopper. Remove battery power, connect setup through USB, re-connect power (with smoke stopper) and verify the voltage readout in BetaFlight","tags":"","url":"Tutorials\/ESC_fuse_fix\/index.html"},{"title":"Li-ion battery pack","text":"Making a Li-Ion battery pack This page shows the steps involved in making a 2S pack with 21700 cells. This guide is also relevant for constructing with 18650 cells. Materials needed: 2x 18650 or 21700 cells (they must both be exactly the same cell!) Large shrink tube (alternative: electrical tape) A balance plug and wire for it (or balance extension cord that you cut) 18 AWG wire (can be thicker if you need more amps) Let's first list the tools that I used: Soldering iron Hot glue gun Wire cutters Knife Heat gun (optional) Tweezers and soldering stand (optional) Multimeter Before you begin Making a battery pack is dangerous. Ensure that you have a basic understanding electricity and lipo &amp; li-ion battery tech. This guide might not be perfect, so proceed at your own risk. Using battery cells incorrectly may lead to fire and physical harm. Treat them with the respect that they deserve. The author is not responsible for any damage or harm that may happen from following the steps in this document. Steps First we start with two identical cells. These are Samsung INR21700-50E cells: You can find the specifications of these cells here. Before we actually start, please note that all wires should be pre-tinned. This will make it much easier to combine the components: Now put the cells together. They must touch each other. I used 2 coasters to help me with that. You can then use a tool to align them vertically: Carefully apply hot glue on one side of the cells. Make sure your glue gun doesn't touch the cells, so you don't melt the plastic wrapper. Let it dry for 30-60 seconds and then do the other side too: Since I don't have a spot, I need to solder them regularly. Before we can add solder to the cells, we need to remove the oxidised layer from the cells. I do this by scraping carefully with a knife. But the cell flat on the table and start scraping at the center of the contact point. Heat the soldering iron to 450 C (842 F). Less might also work, but this is the temperature that I used. Put some solder on your iron, then put the soldering iron on the cell, then add a bunch more solder: Let it cool and then clean off the resin: You can test the strength of your weld by applying force with a knife on the edge of the solder. I had to hold my camera to take a picture, but you should hold the batteries with one hand, and then carefully apply a few kilograms of force with the other hand. Be careful to not cut yourself. Repeat the knife scraping, soldering, cleaning and strength testing for all 4 contact points: Cut a small piece of wire to length to connect 2 battery cells in the back: Make a 2S (3-pin) balance cable to length, or cut one from an existing balance extension cable: Solder the center cable of the balance connector to the back of the battery: Fasten the balance cable with some hot glue. This will make it easier to work with: Measure and cut the remaining 2 wires of the balance cable. Make sure the red cable goes to the positive side of the cell, and the black cable goes to the negative side of the other cell: Then solder the two balance cables onto the cells: Now solder an XT30 connector to the same contacts: We're about to make some covers to protect the top and bottom of the battery pack. Take some double-sided tape, cut it to length. Then apply kapton tape (or electrical tape?) on one side. Measure some shrink tube. It should stick out about 8-10mm on each end of the cells: Hold the lipo by all of its wires and use the heat gun to carefully heat the shrink tube. Your pack is now finished: Since we used Samsung INR21700-50E cells, this battery pack is a 2S pack with 5000 mAh. Even though these are Li-Ion cells, they are charged to 4.2 V. The cut-off voltage is a mere 2.5 V! You can charge at maximum 4900 mA, but it's advised to charge them slower. They can be discharged at 9800 mAh continuously, or 14700 mA pulse. (according to this page) When using different cells than the ones above, make sure to look up the the specifications of these cells. The voltages and currents will very likely be different.","tags":"","url":"Tutorials\/Li_ion_battery_pack\/index.html"}]}
