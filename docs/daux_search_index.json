You can start here! I'm sure you are as eager as I was to start flying, but before you spend a lot of money, please consider trying out a simulator first! The drone you'll choose to fly will depend mainly on what you expect from it. Do you want to just fly at a more relaxed pace to take pictures or just cruise around? Do you want to want to do flips and rolls and all sorts of other tricks? Or do you just want to go FAST and race around, maybe against other people? That, and your budget will very likely drive you to a specific type of drone. Flying a drone is not cheap! It varies greatly depending on how and what you would like to fly. Take a look at the budget article for more information. When you have decided your budget, you can start looking for gear!

Ready To Fly (RTF) There are &quot;ready to fly&quot; kits, which contain all the essentials to get started, will start at around 200 EUR. You might find cheaper, of course, and you'll definitely find more expensive too. If you want to fly a DJI drone, your entry cost will probably be closer to 500 EUR. Build it yourself If you build a drone yourself, you can probably also start off roughly 200 EUR. This means that you'll get the cheapest gear that is available, and will likely not be very reliable. A more realistic price point for a starter is probably around 400-600 EUR, depending on your gear choices.","tags":"","url":"Getting_Started\/Budget.html"},{"title":"Building","text":"Gear to build These are the main things you'll probably end up buying: Soldering iron (soldering tin, desoldering materials, etc.) Multimeter Electrical wire (of various thicknesses) and wire cutter Electrical tape Break knife (or similar) Plier Cutter Tweezers Screw driver set Screw and wrench set Heat shrink","tags":"","url":"Getting_Started\/Building.html"},{"title":"Gear","text":"Minimal loadout Drone Transmitter (the controller) Batteries, charger and storage (such as an ammo box or a BatSafe) Spare sets of propellers What else?

Simulators are a cheap to see if the sport is something you like, and they're great for honing your skill. You can crash your drone hundreds of times in a simulator, and it won't cost you anything extra! Simulators require a controller of some sort, though! While you can use an X-Box or PlayStation controller, it is strongly advised to buy a proper transmitter that you can connect to your PC. This ensures that you won't learn bad habits with the game controller, and gets you familiar with the transmitter\/controller that you'll actually use to fly a real drone.

Home-built drones are most often running LiPo (Lithium-Polymer) batteries. Even though Li-Ion batteries are lighter weight, drones benefit from the extra electric current draw that a LiPo battery can provide. This page will focus on LiPo batteries, but much of its content is just as valid for other types of batteries. Voltage and cell count LiPo batteries are made out of multiple cells. Each cell provides roughly 3.7 V. Depending on how the cells are combined, the battery can have either more longevity and provide more current, or the battery can provide a higher voltage (more power). Essentially, the voltage of the cell determines how fast your drone can go. The current of the cell determines how much of this power can be delivered at a given moment, and thus also affects how fast a drone can go. A battery pack with 1 cell, delivering about 3.7 V is labelled as being a 1S battery. A battery pack with 2 cells delivers twice the voltage, so about 7.4 V and is labelled as a 2S battery. A battery pack with 3 cells delivers three times the voltage, so about 11.2 V and is labelled as a 3S battery. And so on. When a battery is charged, its voltage is higher than when it is discharged. A charged cell is generally at 4.2 V, while a discharged cell is around 3.3 V to 3.5 V, depending on context. When discharging (or using) a battery, it is very important that the voltage never drops below 3.0 V. If this happen, it could damage your battery. Voltage and &quot;sagging&quot; When a battery is under load, the voltage might drop temporarily. This effect is named &quot;sagging&quot;. The effect is especially visible on smaller drones (tinywhoops etc.) and is considered normal on them. Battery capacity The mAh rating of a battery defines its capacity. Let's take a deeper look at it: The rate at which a battery can provide power (Voltage) is expressed in amps (A), or milli-amps (mA). When we talk about battery capacity, we generally talk about how long it can deliver a certain amount of these amps. So when we take in effect the time in hours (h) we get A x h = Ah (or mAh). The capacity of a battery in mAh is its relative capacity: as in, it is relative to the Voltage of the battery. The total energy of a battery is expressed in watt-hours or Wh. Watts are calculated as follows: W = A x V. Thus, a 14.8 V battery with 1500 mAh capacity has 14.8 V x 1.5 Ah = 22,2 Wh of energy. &quot;C&quot; Rating The C rating of a battery refers to the rate of discharge that a battery can provide. The C rating has a direct relationship with the capacity (mAh) of a battery. Let's take a look at some examples: A 1500mAh battery specced at 1 C can deliver 1500mA * 1 = 1.5 A of current. A 2000mAh battery specced at 100 C can deliver 2000mA * 100 = 200 A of current. Thermal Runaway Thermal runaway is a self-sustaining chemical reaction inside the battery, that is potentially dangerous and can lead to fires. LiPo batteries are built to mitigate some of its effects, but it's important to safely dispose of a LiPo battery when this occurs. Thermal runaway becomes visible when the battery swells up. However, thermal runaway can also be active and only visible show symptons many hours after the reaction started internally in the battery. For more details on thermal runaway, please read this article.","tags":"","url":"Technical\/Batteries.html"},{"title":"Flight Controller","text":"Basics The flight controllers is arguably the most important part of a drone or multicopter. These tiny computer control the flight of your drone and can talk to various peripherals that are connected to it. It uses its sensors to detect parameters, such as the movement of your quad. There are 2 main parts of flight controllers: the hardware and the software (firmware). These pages will gloss over the basics of both. Hardware The topic of hardware can generally be divided in 3 main parts: CPU (processor) Physical size Features CPU This is the heart of the flight controller. The faster it is, the faster it can calculate your flight parameters. The more storage it has, the more features the software can contain. Currently, F4 and F7 flight controllers are the most common ones to find. Type Speed Storage F1 72 MHz 128 kB F3 72 MHz 256 kB F4 168 MHz 1 MB F7 216 MHz 1 MB H7 480 MHz 128 kB Read more about CPUs here. Physical Size A flight controller must fit the frame of your drone, otherwise you won't be able to mount it. Flight controller sizes are pretty much standardised. They generally are one if these: 16 x 16 mm 20 x 20 mm 30 x 30 mm 45 x 45 mm Firmware There are various firmware\/software options for your drone. The most common ones on privately built quads are BetaFlight and KISS. BetaFlight BetaFlight is open source and allows for advanced tweaking of flight parameters. Because of that, it is arguably more complex than for example KISS. KISS KISS stands for &quot;Keep It Super Simple&quot;. KISS gives you less configuration options than BetaFlight (and thus less control), and intends to make it easier for you to set up your drone. KISS firmwares are not open source, and its flight Controllers tend to be more expensive.

Please take into account that local restrictions also apply on top of these rules. This documentation is focused on the new guidelines that will come into effect in July 2020. The author(s) take no liability for the statements below. Please act responsibly and and lawfully. An outline from the rules and regulation can be found here. Drone Classification Drones will be mainly classified based on their weight. Within each weight classification, there might also be limitations (and permissions) depending on capabilities of the drone. These sub-classifications generally cover maximum speed, or features such as GPS or failsafe. The base classification is C0, C1, C3 or C4. This will be specified by the manufacturer of store-bought drones. Privately built drones will have no classification, but they are assigned a subcategory, just like the drones that come with a classfication. Some notes on the tables below: The speed limit is the limitation of the drone, not the speed at which you fly it. &quot;Weight&quot; refers to the maximum total take-off weight, including batteries and payload.
