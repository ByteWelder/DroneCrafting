I hope you enjoy reading about my successes, findings and failures. Materials used: 3x compact lipo charger (ISDT Q6 in my case) a case that is large enough to hold everything (mine was 464 x 366 x 176 mm internally, type \u201cMAX 430S\u201d on Amazon) various electrical wire (silicon sleeved, I used 14 AWG for the power delivery spec that I wanted) 3x balance connector distribution board (search on AliExpress for \u201cB6AC A6 Charger\u201d) power distribution board (optional) 6x 40 mm fan (can be more\/less, depending on your ventilation requirements) 6x fan cover (e.g. plastic mesh) switching power supply (24 V and 15 A) top plate material (e.g. triplex) a bunch of XT60 and XT30 connectors, including 3x top-mounted XT60 (see pics below) 220 V power outlet with switch and fuse (the same one as the Ender 3 Pro comes with) (note: this might be incomplete) These are some of the tools that I remember using: Soldering iron 3D printer (optional) Hot glue gun Wire cutters Knife Heat gun (optional) Tweezers and soldering stand Multimeter Something to cut out the top plate (e.g. drill, jigsaw and Dremel** I also designed some parts: ISDT Q6 bracket: STL, FreeCAD Balance board support plate: STL, FreeCAD These parts are optional, as you can also use pieces of wood or plexiglass to construct something similar. The total cost as about EUR 250 with the ISDT chargers. Half of that amount was just the cost of the chargers, so buying a cheaper charger could save some money. I also bought some components that were optional (PDB, more fans, etc.) You could probably bring the total down to slightly below EUR 200 if you\u2019re making some different choices here and there. Steps First, I bought a case. It was relatively cheap, and the only downside was that it is a bit heavy: The next step was to start creating a bottom plate. I wanted to keep it detachable, so I bought some 3M Dual Lock. I added a bit too much in retrospect, so when I detach the plate, sometimes the sticky tape comes off rather than the Dual Lock: On this bottom plate, I added the switching power supply. The main consideration here was to have it placed in such a way that the combined airflow of the power supply unit (PSU) was working well with the airflow of the chargers. Another consideration was how the placement would affect the center of gravity of the case, so it would be nice to carry. I mounted the PSU on the wooden plate with standoffs, so that the airflow would be better. I also wanted to make sure that if the power supply ever got really hot (which I don\u2019t expect), it wouldn\u2019t be touching the wood: Here it is placed in the case: Similarly, I created a top plate. It rests nicely on the rim of the case, and due to the design of the case, the lid still closes perfectly. I drew some edges on it, to visualize how much actual space was usable. That way, I wouldn\u2019t be hitting the side of the case: I made many sketches on paper before picking my preferred layout. I laid some of the components on the paper to see if it would work well. The considerations were: airflow, wire connections (amount of wire needed), space during charging (how close is everything to each other). After that was done, I transferred my layout to the top plate: And of course I verified it by adding the components on top: At this point, I started prepping wires already. This would allow me to already connect the chargers and start charging. That way, I didn\u2019t have to wait to the end of the project until I\u2019d have a functioning charging setup! As you can see, the rig was already functionally usable: I wanted a single wire to go from the PSU to the rest of the electronics. This allows me to easily disconnect the electronics on the top plate from the PSU on the bottom for maintenance and testing. In theory, I could just solder all the XT60 connectors together, in parallel, and be done with it. I chose another path and bought a power distribution board (PDB) to make the job a bit prettier. This PDB also comes with a BEC, so I could easily add some LEDs to the case later, or add more electronics that require a lower voltage. To this PDB, I added some extra BECs (step down converters) that will drive the fans. They are separate, as I need more current from it than the PDB will give me. The BECs allow me to regulate the voltage, effectively allowing me to change the speed of the fans. I am adding XT60 and XT30 connectors, because I want the entire thing to be modular and easy to disassemble: Originally, I had only 1 BEC. This provided insufficient power to start rotating all fans at the same time. I added a second BEC to solve this problem, but in the end it was still insufficient. The proper fix would be to have a setup where each fan gets its own switch. That way, they can all individually get their needed current spike to start spinning - but not at least not at the same time! At this point I started cutting out the top plate: Because I used triplex wood, and I\u2019m not super experienced with it, the wood partially disintegrated when cutting into it. I used some 2 component epoxy filler to fix most of it: To finish the top plate, I painted it black: Also the fans were mounted: Then the XT60 top-mounted connectors were added: Because the chargers were shaped irregularly, and I needed to support the balance boards with something, I designed and printed out some parts. You can also buy some wood or plexiglass and cut out similar parts by hand. I used 2 component epoxy filler (yes, filler) to glue the charger brackets on: Then I put the balance charging cables in place and glued in the supports for the balance board: The lasts step was to connect everything: And then the project was finished:","tags":"","url":"Tutorials\/Charging_case\/index.html"},{"title":"ESC fuse fix","text":"ESC Fuse Fix I ordered a bunch of RushFPV Mini Tank Stacks that were rated for 30 A and connected them to some DYS Samguk 2600 Kv motors without propellers. This minimal load blew the fuse on the ESC, making the ESC unusable. The result was that BetaFlight showed 0.01 V when a lipo was connected. A friendly RushFPV customer support representative stated that this stack wasn\u2019t meant for 5&quot; quadcopters and motors with such high Kv values. In my opinion, 30 A is 30 A, regardless of motor size, so I\u2019m still under the impression that this stack just can\u2019t deliver what it says on the specifications. Thanks to the help of the RushFPV CSR, I was advised to bridge the fuse. I was given some pictures as a guide, but decided to make a comprehensive photo write-up myself. These are the tools that I used: ultra-fine tweezers soldering iron with (thin) chisel tip copper wire (preferably single core) clippers If you plan to fix your own ESC, you should understand that removing the fuse (and shorting\/bridging it) means that there is nothing preventing damage to the ESC if too much current is pulled through it. It can lead to smoke and fire if you abuse the ESC beyond its limits without this safety net. First, let\u2019s take a look at the fuse itself. It\u2019s the green SMD component on the ESC: As mentioned in the list of tools, I used a fine chisel tip: Use the clippers to splice the wire length-wise. Then cut a smaller piece off that is a bit smaller than the size of the fuse: Have your soldering iron on high heat (I put mine on 425 C) and add a little bit of solder. This solder will help spread the heat on the SMD component: Start holding the fuse with the tweezers. Don\u2019t put a lot of force on it, but make sure you grab hold of it: Bring the soldering iron to the fuse (don\u2019t push hard) and gently pull the fuse off with the tweezers: The ESC will now look like this: Add some fresh solder to the fuse pads. I used the sharp end of the chisel tip to set down my iron in a stable manner, and then I fed a little bit of solder into it: Now place the tiny piece of copper wire, with the flat side down, between the ESC fuse pads. Before you put the soldering iron down, make sure that you have some grip on the wire, as it will start sliding a bit when the solder is flowing. To solder it, just put your iron down on the copper bit and let the heat of the copper conduct into the solder and melt the solder into the copper: That\u2019s it, you\u2019ve now bridged the fuse! You can test as follows: Continuity test on fuse and ESC battery pads. Power on the ESC with a battery and a smoke stopper. Remove battery power, add the FC and do another power on test with the smoke stopper. Remove battery power, connect setup through USB, re-connect power (with smoke stopper) and verify the voltage readout in BetaFlight","tags":"","url":"Tutorials\/ESC_fuse_fix\/index.html"},{"title":"Li-ion battery pack","text":"Making a Li-Ion battery pack This page shows the steps involved in making a 2S pack with 21700 cells. This guide is also relevant for constructing with 18650 cells. Materials needed: 2x 18650 or 21700 cells (they must both be exactly the same cell!) Large shrink tube (alternative: electrical tape) A balance plug and wire for it (or balance extension cord that you cut) 18 AWG wire (can be thicker if you need more amps) Let\u2019s first list the tools that I used: Soldering iron Hot glue gun Wire cutters Knife Heat gun (optional) Tweezers and soldering stand (optional) Multimeter Before you begin Making a battery pack is dangerous. Ensure that you have a basic understanding electricity and lipo &amp; li-ion battery tech. This guide might not be perfect, so proceed at your own risk. Using battery cells incorrectly may lead to fire and physical harm. Treat them with the respect that they deserve. The author is not responsible for any damage or harm that may happen from following the steps in this document. Steps First we start with two identical cells. These are Samsung INR21700-50E cells: You can find the specifications of these cells here. Before we actually start, please note that all wires should be pre-tinned. This will make it much easier to combine the components: Now put the cells together. They must touch each other. I used 2 coasters to help me with that. You can then use a tool to align them vertically: Carefully apply hot glue on one side of the cells. Make sure your glue gun doesn\u2019t touch the cells, so you don\u2019t melt the plastic wrapper. Let it dry for 30-60 seconds and then do the other side too: Since I don\u2019t have a spot, I need to solder them regularly. Before we can add solder to the cells, we need to remove the oxidised layer from the cells. I do this by scraping carefully with a knife. But the cell flat on the table and start scraping at the center of the contact point. Heat the soldering iron to 450 C (842 F). Less might also work, but this is the temperature that I used. Put some solder on your iron, then put the soldering iron on the cell, then add a bunch more solder: Let it cool and then clean off the resin: You can test the strength of your weld by applying force with a knife on the edge of the solder. I had to hold my camera to take a picture, but you should hold the batteries with one hand, and then carefully apply a few kilograms of force with the other hand. Be careful to not cut yourself. Repeat the knife scraping, soldering, cleaning and strength testing for all 4 contact points: Cut a small piece of wire to length to connect 2 battery cells in the back: Make a 2S (3-pin) balance cable to length, or cut one from an existing balance extension cable: Solder the center cable of the balance connector to the back of the battery: Fasten the balance cable with some hot glue. This will make it easier to work with: Measure and cut the remaining 2 wires of the balance cable. Make sure the red cable goes to the positive side of the cell, and the black cable goes to the negative side of the other cell: Then solder the two balance cables onto the cells: Now solder an XT30 connector to the same contacts: We\u2019re about to make some covers to protect the top and bottom of the battery pack. Take some double-sided tape, cut it to length. Then apply kapton tape (or electrical tape?) on one side. Measure some shrink tube. It should stick out about 8-10mm on each end of the cells: Hold the lipo by all of its wires and use the heat gun to carefully heat the shrink tube. Your pack is now finished: Since we used Samsung INR21700-50E cells, this battery pack is a 2S pack with 5000 mAh. Even though these are Li-Ion cells, they are charged to 4.2 V. The cut-off voltage is a mere 2.5 V! You can charge at maximum 4900 mA, but it\u2019s advised to charge them slower. They can be discharged at 9800 mAh continuously, or 14700 mA pulse. (according to this page) When using different cells than the ones above, make sure to look up the the specifications of these cells. The voltages and currents will very likely be different.","tags":"","url":"Tutorials\/Li_ion_battery_pack\/index.html"}]});
