Please take into account that local restrictions also apply on top of these rules. This documentation is focused on the new guidelines that will come into effect in July 2020. The author(s) take no liability for the statements below. Please act responsibly and and lawfully. An outline from the rules and regulation can be found here. Drone Classification Drones will be mainly classified based on their weight. Within each weight classification, there might also be limitations (and permissions) depending on capabilities of the drone. These sub-classifications generally cover maximum speed, or features such as GPS or failsafe. The base classification is C0, C1, C3 or C4. This will be specified by the manufacturer of store-bought drones. Privately built drones will have no classification, but they are assigned a subcategory, just like the drones that come with a classfication. Because people generally fly either privately built drones or store-bought ones, I've divided the table up in 2 parts: Some notes on the tables below: The speed limit is the limitation of the drone, not the speed at which you fly it. &quot;Weight&quot; refers to the maximum total take-off weight, including batteries and payload. If you find inaccuracies on these pages, please inform us. Store bought drone classification This covers all drones that were sold on\/after July 2020 with a class label (Cx). Class Weight Subcategory Distance from people Operator registration Pilot competence RemoteID C0 &lt; 250 g A1 Can fly over uninvolved people (not crowds) No Read owner manual No C1 &lt; 900 g A1 Can fly over uninvolved people (not crowds) Yes Read manual, pass online test Yes C2 &lt; 4 kg A2 Fly at safe distance away from uninvolved people Yes Read manual, pass online test, extra test (*) Yes C3 &lt; 25 kg A3 Avoid people and urban areas Yes Read manual, pass online test Yes C4 &lt; 25 kg A3 Avoid people and urban areas Yes Read manual, pass online test Yes (*) Only if you want to fly close to non-involved people. Store bought drones without classification This covers all drones that were store bought and have a 19 m\/s speed limit, but they were sold before July 2020, so they don't have an official Cx label. None of these drones require RemoteID.
