Please take into account that local restrictions also apply on top of these rules. This documentation is focused on the new guidelines that will come into effect in July 2020. The author(s) take no liability for the statements below. Please act responsibly and and lawfully. An outline from the rules and regulation can be found here. Categories Drones will be mainly classified based on their weight. Within each weight classification, there might also be limitations (and permissions) depending on capabilities of the drone. These sub-classifications generally cover maximum speed, or features such as GPS or failsafe. The base classification is C0, C1, C3 or C4. This will be specified by the manufacturer of store-bought drones. Privately built drones will have no classification, but they are assigned a subcategory, just like the drones that come with a classfication.
