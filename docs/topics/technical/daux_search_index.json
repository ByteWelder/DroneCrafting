These tiny computer control the flight of your drone and can talk to various peripherals that are connected to it. It uses its sensors to detect parameters, such as the movement of your quad. There are 2 main parts of flight controllers: the hardware and the software (firmware). These pages will gloss over the basics of both. Hardware The topic of hardware can generally be divided in 3 main parts: CPU (processor) Physical size Features CPU This is the heart of the flight controller. The faster it is, the faster it can calculate your flight parameters. The more storage it has, the more features the software can contain. Currently, F4 and F7 flight controllers are the most common ones to find. Type Speed Storage F1 72 MHz 128 kB F3 72 MHz 256 kB F4 168 MHz 1 MB F7 216 MHz 1 MB H7 480 MHz 128 kB Read more about CPUs here. Physical Size A flight controller must fit the frame of your drone, otherwise you won't be able to mount it. Flight controller sizes are pretty much standardised. They generally are one if these: 16 x 16 mm 20 x 20 mm 30 x 30 mm 45 x 45 mm Firmware There are various firmware\/software options for your drone. The most common ones on privately built quads are BetaFlight and KISS. BetaFlight BetaFlight is open source and allows for advanced tweaking of flight parameters. Because of that, it is arguably more complex than for example KISS. KISS KISS stands for &quot;Keep It Super Simple&quot;. KISS gives you less configuration options than BetaFlight (and thus less control), and intends to make it easier for you to set up your drone. KISS firmwares are not open source, and its flight Controllers tend to be more expensive.
