{"pages":[{"title":"Getting Started","text":"Introduction Want to start flying drones, you're not sure what to buy, how much it costs, or what to get? You can start here! I'm sure you are as eager as I was to start flying, but before you spend a lot of money, please consider trying out a simulator first! The drone you'll choose to fly will depend mainly on what you expect from it. Do you want to just fly at a more relaxed pace to take pictures or just cruise around? Do you want to want to do flips and rolls and all sorts of other tricks? Or do you just want to go FAST and race around, maybe against other people? That, and your budget will very likely drive you to a specific type of drone. Flying a drone is not cheap! It varies greatly depending on how and what you would like to fly. Take a look at the budget article for more information. When you have decided your budget, you can start looking for gear!

Ready To Fly (RTF) There are &quot;ready to fly&quot; kits, which contain all the essentials to get started, will start at around 200 EUR. You might find cheaper, of course, and you'll definitely find more expensive too. If you want to fly a DJI drone, your entry cost will probably be closer to 500 EUR. Build it yourself If you build a drone yourself, you can probably also start off roughly 200 EUR. This means that you'll get the cheapest gear that is available, and will likely not be very reliable. A more realistic price point for a starter is probably around 400-600 EUR, depending on your gear choices.","tags":"","url":"Budget\/index.html"},{"title":"Building","text":"Gear to build These are the main things you'll probably end up buying: Soldering iron (soldering tin, desoldering materials, etc.) Multimeter Electrical wire (of various thicknesses) and wire cutter Electrical tape Break knife (or similar) Plier Cutter Tweezers Screw driver set Screw and wrench set Heat shrink","tags":"","url":"Building\/index.html"},{"title":"Gear","text":"Minimal loadout Drone Transmitter (the controller) Batteries, charger and storage (such as an ammo box or a BatSafe) Spare sets of propellers What else?

Simulators are a cheap to see if the sport is something you like, and they're great for honing your skill. You can crash your drone hundreds of times in a simulator, and it won't cost you anything extra! Simulators require a controller of some sort, though! While you can use an X-Box or PlayStation controller, it is strongly advised to buy a proper transmitter that you can connect to your PC. This ensures that you won't learn bad habits with the game controller, and gets you familiar with the transmitter\/controller that you'll actually use to fly a real drone.
