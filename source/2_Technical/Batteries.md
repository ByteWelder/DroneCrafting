# LiPo or Li-Ion?

Home-built drones are most often running LiPo (Lithium-Polymer) batteries. Even though Li-Ion
batteries are lighter weight, drones benefit from the extra [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current)
draw that a LiPo battery can provide.

This page will focus on LiPo batteries, but much of its content is just as valid for other types of batteries.

# First some theory

There are 4 units that are relevant to batteries:
- Voltage: expressed in _volts_ with its unit `V` and the symbol (for equations) `U`.
- Current: expressed in _amps_ with its unit `A` and the symbol `I`.
- Resistance: expressed in _Ohms_ with its unit `Î©` and the symbol `R`.
- Power: expressed in _watts_ with its unit `W` and the symbol `P`.

[Voltage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage) is the potential difference or **electric tension between two points**.
The voltage of the cell is one of the main drivers of how fast your drone will be able to fly.

[Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) is the **rate of flow** of electric charge.
So even if you have a high voltage, you still need to deliver a high enough current (more amps) to let the energy flow to your motors.

[Resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance) is the measure that determines
the amount of **opposition to the flow of electrical current**. Your electrical circuits will have some sort of
resistance, but also the wires that connect your battery will have a (minimal) resistance.

[Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power) refers to the **electrical energy** that is being provided per unit of time.
When we combine voltage and amps, we get power. (P = U x I)

# Voltage and cell count

LiPo batteries are made out of multiple cells. Each cell provides roughly `3.7 V`.
Depending on how the cells are combined, the battery can have either more longevity
and provide more current, or the battery can provide a higher voltage.

A battery pack with 1 cell, delivering about `3.7 V` is labelled as being a `1S` battery.
A battery pack with 2 cells delivers twice the voltage, so about `7.4 V` and is labelled as a `2S` battery.
A battery pack with 3 cells delivers three times the voltage, so about `11.2 V` and is labelled as a `3S` battery.
And so on.

When a battery is charged, its voltage is higher than when it is discharged.
A charged cell is generally at `4.2 V`, while a discharged cell is around `3.3 V` to `3.5 V`, depending on context.
When discharging (or using) a battery, it is **very** important that the voltage never drops below `3.0 V`.
If this happens, it could damage your battery.

# Voltage and "sagging"

When a battery is under load, the voltage might drop temporarily. This effect is named "sagging".
The effect is especially visible on smaller drones (tinywhoops etc.) and is considered normal on them.

# Battery capacity

The `mAh` rating of a battery defines its capacity. Let's take a deeper look at it:
`Ah` is referred to as "amp hours". In other words: the duration (in hours) at which a certain amount of
current(amps) can be sustained.

The rate at which a battery can provide power is expressed in amps (`A`), or milli-amps (`mA`).
When we talk about battery capacity, we generally talk about how long it can deliver a certain amount of these amps.
So when we take in effect the time in hours (`h`) we get `A` x `h` = `Ah` (or `mAh`).

The capacity of a battery in `mAh` is its relative capacity: as in, it is relative to the voltage of the battery.
The total energy of a battery is defined is expressed in watt-hours or `Wh`. This takes in account the
voltage, the amps and the time (in hours).

Thus, a `14.8 V` battery with `1500 mAh` capacity has `14.8 V` x `1.5 Ah` = `22,2 Wh` of energy.

# "C" Rating

The C rating of a battery refers to the rate of discharge that a battery can provide.
The C rating has a direct relationship with the capacity (mAh) of a battery. Let's take a look at some examples:

- A `1500mAh` battery specced at `1 C` can deliver `1500mA` * `1` = `1.5 A` of current.
- A `2000mAh` battery specced at `100 C` can deliver `2000mA` * `100` = `200 A` of current.

# Thermal Runaway

Thermal runaway is a self-sustaining chemical reaction inside the battery, that is potentially dangerous
and can lead to fires. LiPo batteries are built to mitigate some of its effects, but it's important to
safely dispose of a LiPo battery when this occurs.

Thermal runaway becomes visible when the battery swells up. However, thermal runaway can also be active
and only visible show symptons many hours after the reaction started internally in the battery.
