# Introduction

Want to start flying drones, you're not sure what to buy, how much it costs, or what to get?
You can start here!

I'm sure you are as eager as I was to start flying, but before you spend _a lot_ of money,
please consider trying out a [simulator](Simulators) first!

The drone you'll choose to fly will depend mainly on what you expect from it.
Do you want to just fly at a more relaxed pace to take pictures or just cruise around?
Do you want to want to do flips and rolls and all sorts of other tricks?
Or do you just want to go FAST and race around, maybe against other people?

That, and your budget will very likely drive you to a specific type of drone.

Flying a drone is not cheap! It varies greatly depending on how and what you would like to fly.
Take a look at the [budget](Budget) article for more information.

When you have decided your budget, you can start looking for [gear](Gear)!
