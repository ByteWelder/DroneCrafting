# EU Regulations For Civil Drones

Below are the rules you must adhere to when operating a drone for civil use in the European Union.
Please take into account that local restrictions also apply on top of these rules.

This documentation is focused on the new guidelines that will come into effect in July 2020.

# Categories

Drones will be mainly classified based on their weight. Within each weight classification, there might also be
limitations (and permissions) depending on capabilities of the drone. These sub-classifications generally cover
maximum speed, or features such as GPS or failsafe.

The base classification is `C0`, `C1`, `C3` or `C4`. This will be specified by the manufacturer of store-bought drones. 
Privately built drones will have no classification, but they are assigned a subcategory, just like the drones that come with
a classfication.
