Flying a drone is not cheap, but thanks to our Chinese overlords
(like [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com) and [BangGood](https://www.banggood.com)),
we can buy parts and gear relatively cheap these days.

## Ready To Fly (RTF)

There are "ready to fly" kits, which contain all the essentials to get started, will
start at around 200 EUR. You might find cheaper, of course, and you'll definitely find more expensive too.

If you want to fly a DJI drone, your entry cost will probably be closer to 500 EUR.

## Build it yourself

If you build a drone yourself, you can probably also start off roughly 200 EUR.
This means that you'll get the cheapest gear that is available, and will likely not be very reliable.

A more realistic price point for a starter is probably around 400-600 EUR, depending on your gear choices.
