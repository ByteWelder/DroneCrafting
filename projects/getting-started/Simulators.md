I'm sure you are as eager as I was to start flying, but before you spend _a lot_ of money,
please consider trying out a simulator first! Simulators are a cheap to see if the sport
is something you like, and they're great for honing your skill.
You can crash your drone hundreds of times in a simulator, and it won't cost you anything extra!

Simulators require a controller of some sort, though! While you can use an X-Box or PlayStation
controller, it is strongly advised to buy a proper transmitter that you can connect to your PC.
This ensures that you won't learn bad habits with the game controller, and gets you familiar
with the transmitter/controller that you'll actually use to fly a real drone.
